# Software Engineering Portfolio

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my software engineering portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of academic and personal projects focused on **backend and full-stack development**, highlighting my experience building scalable systems, APIs, and data-driven applications.

Across these projects, I’ve worked on designing and implementing backend services, integrating third-party APIs, developing application logic, and collaborating across the full development lifecycle. My work emphasizes clean architecture, performance, and maintainability, with a strong focus on solving real-world problems through thoughtful system design.

Each project includes documentation and links to its respective repository, providing deeper insight into the technical decisions, tools, and tradeoffs involved.
